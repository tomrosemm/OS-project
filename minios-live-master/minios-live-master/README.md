### üõ†Ô∏è Building MiniOS

MiniOS provides two powerful tools for building customized ISO images:

- **`minios-cmd`:**  This command-line utility simplifies the configuration and initiation of builds.  It provides a user-friendly interface for setting various build parameters like the target distribution, architecture, desktop environment, kernel options, locale, and more.  `minios-cmd` then uses these parameters to generate a configuration file for `minios-live` and automatically triggers the build process.  [Learn more about building with `minios-cmd`](docs/minios-cmd.md).

- **`minios-live`:** This script orchestrates the step-by-step build process. It handles tasks such as setting up the build environment, installing the base system, integrating the chosen desktop environment, creating the SquashFS filesystem, configuring the boot process, and finally generating the bootable ISO image.
